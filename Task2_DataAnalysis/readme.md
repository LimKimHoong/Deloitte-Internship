## Here is the background information

Having our data unification algorithm, Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

1. Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
2. Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
3. Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
4. Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each location has **9 types of machines**, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:
- In which location did machines break the most?
- What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
