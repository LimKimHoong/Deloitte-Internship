** Here is the background information on this task 

Deloitte have signed a new account - **Daikibo Industrials**, a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. They needed assistance with a variety of problems and were impressed to find out Deloitte could help in all verticals.

Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT  (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data  in one format, and the other half - in another. They need our help to combine the two.
